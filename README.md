# OmniAuth Mondo

This is an unofficial OmniAuth strategy for authenticating to Mondo, It's purely for my [Mondo Tab](https://github.com/jameshill/mondo-tab) demo. I'm not actively maintaining it.

As a result it's not published on rubygems etc. So if you want to install via your Gemfile you'll need to use the following:

```
gem 'omniauth-mondo', git: 'https://github.com/jameshill/omniauth-mondo.git'
```
